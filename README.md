Case Study 1 Painting Hire Business


System Description:

A local businesswoman has decided to start her own Internet business, called Masterpieces Ltd, hiring
paintings to private individuals and commercial companies.

Because of your reputation as a database designer she has called upon your services to design and
implement a database to support her new business. At the initial planning meeting, to discuss the design,
the following user requirements were requested.


The system must be able to manage the details of customers, paintings and those paintings currently on
hire to customers. Customers are categorized as B (bronze), S (silver), G (gold) or P (platinum). These
categories entitle a customer to a discount of 0%, 5%, 10% or 15% respectively.


Customers often request paintings by a particular artist or theme (eg animal, landscape, seascape, naval,
still‚Äêlife, etc). Over time a customer may hire the same painting more than once.


Each painting is allocated a customer monthly rental price defined by the owner. The owner of the
painting is then paid 10% of that customer rental price. Any paintings that are not hired within six months
are returned to the owner. However, after three months, an owner may resubmit a returned painting.
Each painting can only have one artist associated with it.


Several reports are required from the system. Three main ones are:

For each customer, a report showing an overview of all the paintings they have hired or are currently
hiring
For each artist, a report of all paintings submitted for hire
For each artist, a returns report for those paintings not hired over the past six months
